The fire department said the blaze was threatening 2,522 structures, three of which have already been destroyed. This video, taken in Santa Paula on Friday, shows a plane dropping fire retardant as thick smoke from the blaze limits visibility. Control of the fire increased overnight, with a jump from zero percent containment to 20 percent on Saturday morning, the fire department said. However, firefighters were forced to halt air operations multiple times overnight due to illegal drones flying over the fire and posing a collision risk, local media reported. The VCFD lifted mandatory evacuation orders on Saturday for some neighborhoods, but an evacuation boundary was still in place for other areas near the fire. Credit: @_kar_ina via Storyful',\n",

He wanders among his herd of cows who are also very happy here on this small chunk of paradise. They have hundreds of acres of lush, green meadow to graze on and ponds full of fresh water to drink. They even have a scratching post with brushes for soothing those itches. Gus is a big boy with big ears and a big itch inside one of them. He patiently waited for his turn at the post while Ethel had a good scratch. When he had the chance, he moved in for some relief. He rubbed his head and his ear and he seemed intent on trying to fit the big brush inside his ear to get at the right spot. Gus\\' buddy, Dave was watching all of this. Dave had come over for a visit that day, bringing Gus\\' favorite treat, an entire loaf of bread. Gus had devoured the loaf in under a minute and now he was a happy bull, except of the itch in his ear. Dave watched Gus trying his best to scratch that itch. In fact, the entire herd was gathered around Gus and they watched him as well. Eventually, Dave thought it best to lend a hand. Gus could use a little help from somebody with fingers and thumbs who could do a better job. Not all bulls would allow this, and not all bulls would even permit somebody to get so close to his females, but Gus is as relaxed as a bull can be. Dave walked up and started rubbing Gus\\' massive ear. Gus obviously appreciated the assistance and he moved his head to make things easier. He let out a few \"moos\" of contentment and then he wandered away. As Gus takes a few steps away from the brushes, we get a great look at his massive shoulders and rippling muscles. He weighs as much as ten very solid, grown men. Maybe it\\'s because Gus isn\\'t threatened by anything, or maybe it\\'s sheer luck that he\\'s so relaxed, but he doesn\\'t ever react with aggression or hostility. Of course, trying to scratch the ear of a grown bull, or even getting this close to one, is not always wise. Gus is definitely an exception and, even at that, his massive size and strength make him an animal to be respected.',\n",

The pigs are wild and they live on the edge of a jungle around a village on Vava'u Island in Tonga. Pigs are farmed here but they often run free, grazing and eating whatever they can find. Many pigs are fully wild, like this one and they can be seen foraging for food in compost heaps, farmer's fields, and under fruit trees. This very loving mother has ten piglets and they are extremely hungry. She lies down on the ground every few hours to let them feed. They nurse hungrily, climbing on each other adorably as they scramble for a chance at the best milk. This mother was also seen hiding her piglets in a little thicket so she could lie down beside them and sleep. Fiercely protective, the mother pig would be a formidable opponent for any dog or other predator who decided to try harming one of these little piglets. They will feed and grow rapidly under her watchful eye. They will need to be fast and strong if they want to survive life in the jungle. Tonga is a beautiful Kingdom with islands surrounded by crystal blue water. A visit here is like stepping back in time as guests witness a simple lifestyle and traditional ways. The Kingdom has not been industrialized as heavily as North America or Europe, and the people here enjoy a beautiful and natural home. But life is also hard and they work for everything, including food. Pigs like these are harvested as a food source by many. Hopefully, these little piglets will learn quickly and keep their wits about them.\",\n",

He wanders among his herd of cows who are also very happy here on this small chunk of paradise. They have hundreds of acres of lush, green meadow to graze on and ponds full of fresh water to drink. They even have a scratching post with brushes for soothing those itches. Gus is a big boy with big ears and a big itch inside one of them. He patiently waited for his turn at the post while Ethel had a good scratch. When he had the chance, he moved in for some relief. He rubbed his head and his ear and he seemed intent on trying to fit the big brush inside his ear to get at the right spot. Gus\\' buddy, Dave was watching all of this. Dave had come over for a visit that day, bringing Gus\\' favorite treat, an entire loaf of bread. Gus had devoured the loaf in under a minute and now he was a happy bull, except of the itch in his ear. Dave watched Gus trying his best to scratch that itch. In fact, the entire herd was gathered around Gus and they watched him as well. Eventually, Dave thought it best to lend a hand. Gus could use a little help from somebody with fingers and thumbs who could do a better job. Not all bulls would allow this, and not all bulls would even permit somebody to get so close to his females, but Gus is as relaxed as a bull can be. Dave walked up and started rubbing Gus\\' massive ear. Gus obviously appreciated the assistance and he moved his head to make things easier. He let out a few \"moos\" of contentment and then he wandered away. As Gus takes a few steps away from the brushes, we get a great look at his massive shoulders and rippling muscles. He weighs as much as ten very solid, grown men. Maybe it\\'s because Gus isn\\'t threatened by anything, or maybe it\\'s sheer luck that he\\'s so relaxed, but he doesn\\'t ever react with aggression or hostility. Of course, trying to scratch the ear of a grown bull, or even getting this close to one, is not always wise. Gus is definitely an exception and, even at that, his massive size and strength make him an animal to be respected.': 6825,\n",

The pigs are wild and they live on the edge of a jungle around a village on Vava'u Island in Tonga. Pigs are farmed here but they often run free, grazing and eating whatever they can find. Many pigs are fully wild, like this one and they can be seen foraging for food in compost heaps, farmer's fields, and under fruit trees. This very loving mother has ten piglets and they are extremely hungry. She lies down on the ground every few hours to let them feed. They nurse hungrily, climbing on each other adorably as they scramble for a chance at the best milk. This mother was also seen hiding her piglets in a little thicket so she could lie down beside them and sleep. Fiercely protective, the mother pig would be a formidable opponent for any dog or other predator who decided to try harming one of these little piglets. They will feed and grow rapidly under her watchful eye. They will need to be fast and strong if they want to survive life in the jungle. Tonga is a beautiful Kingdom with islands surrounded by crystal blue water. A visit here is like stepping back in time as guests witness a simple lifestyle and traditional ways. The Kingdom has not been industrialized as heavily as North America or Europe, and the people here enjoy a beautiful and natural home.
